General Assembly syntax:

operation <dest>, <src>

dest, src can be: register, mem address or value
operations: intuitive mnemonics

Example
8048375		89 e5		mov rbp,rsp
8048377		83 ec 08	sub esp,0x8

On the far right is the assembly instructions that gets exec
at the mem address 8048375
Move the value from rps to ebp
Then subtract 8 from esp
